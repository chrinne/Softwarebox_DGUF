  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that a core ontology is one of the key building blocks necessary to enable the scalable assimilation of information from diverse sources. A complete and extensible ontology that expresses the basic concepts that are common across a variety of domains and can provide the basis for specialization into domain-specific concepts and vocabularies, is essential for well-defined mappings between domain-specific knowledge representations (i.e. metadata vocabularies) and the subsequent building of a variety of services such as cross-domain searching, browsing, data mining and knowledge extraction. This paper describes the results of a series of three workshops held in 2001 and 2002 which brought together representatives from the cultural heritage and digital library communities with the goal of harmonizing their knowledge perspectives and producing a core ontology. The knowledge perspectives of these two communities were represented by the CIDOC/CRM [31], an ontology for information exchange in the cultural heritage and museum community, and the ABC ontology [33], a model for the exchange and integration of digital library information. This paper describes the mediation process between these two different knowledge biases and the results of this mediation - the harmonization of the ABC and CIDOC/CRM ontologies, which we believe may provide a useful basis for information integration in the wider scope of the involved communities.},

  abstract = {The ability to link and compare diverse archaeological data sets will catalyze innovative research of great scope and analytic rigor. However, information heterogeneity and limited budgets and information technology skills challenge data dissemination initiatives. This paper argues for new methods of community-based data integration pioneered by the University of Chicago's Extensible Markup Language (XML) System for Textual and Archaeological Research project (XSTAR). With XSTAR, data integration takes place in two steps: (1) syntactic-schematic integration: Legacy data sets are migrated for representation in the data structures described by the Archaeological Markup Language (ArchaeoML), and (2) Semantic integration: Mappings must be established between related terms and classes in each source database. Because the nuances of meaning are often very subtle, human experts must classify related items in each data set. Initial syntactic-schematic mapping of data into XSTAR is simple and fast but occurs at a relatively abstract level of meaning. Nevertheless, this initial step can accommodate diverse archaeological (and other) data sets, and will facilitate community-led development of more semantically specific data integration. XSTAR hopes to enable multiple semantic data integration schemas to develop and keep pace with changing research agendas. though rooted in archaeology, this paper discusses challenges faced by many disciplines in encouraging more powerful diachronic and regional syntheses. ArchaeoML's highly generalized data model has applicability outside archaeology, especially with subdisciplines of the earth sciences yet to develop formal ontologies. In addition, because this is a community driven approach, incentives for community participation must be explored. Intellectual property and professional rewards are key factors in determining the success of online dissemination systems across many disciplines.},

Ahierarchical ``item-based'' model is proposed which canbe readily implemented as an Extensible MarkupLanguage (XML) tagging scheme that can represent anykind of archaeological data and deliver it in across-platform, standardized fashion to any Webbrowser. This tagging scheme and the data model itimplements permit seamless integration and jointquerying of archaeological datasets derived from manydifferent sources.},
